### Who am I?
I'm a geek living in Montreal. I'm passionate about clean software, hardware and cyber security, but I love to geek out about anything that gets vaguely technical.

I'm currently working at [Crewdle](https://crewdle.com) (an eco-friendly video conferencing platform) as a senior software developer. Before that, I was a senior architect/dev(ops) on Bell Canada's IoT platform.

In my free time, I'm either chipping away at silly side project that you might read about here, or out in the woods hiking and camping.

### What is this place?
Welcome to my little piece of the internet. This site is ~~my blog/portfolio/scratchpad~~ a work in progress. I like to write about

* Things I've learned
* Silly side projects (usually, but not always hardware based)
* Random thoughts on software development

but anything goes! Maybe I'll post a recipe one of these days :man_shrugging:

### Saying hi!
If you want to say hi, you can reach me at [hello@nadav.ca](mailto:hello@nadav.ca) or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin}}). I'm always happy to hear thoughts about the things I've written (or the mistakes I've made). N'hésitez pas non plus à dire bonjour en français!
