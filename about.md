### Who am I?

I'm a semi-nomadic software developer living in Montreal who will happily talk your ear off about writing maintainable software, travel, camping, cooking, and film photography. That said, I love to geek out about anything that gets vaguely technical.

I'm currently a Senior Backend Software Engineer at [OpenPhone/Quo](https://www.quo.com). Previously, I co-founded [Redeo API](https://redeoapi.com). If you're curious about what I was doing before _that_, have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin}}).

In my free time, I'm either chipping away at a silly side project (that you might read about here), or out in the woods hiking and camping.

### What is this place?

Welcome to my little piece of the internet. This site is ~~my blog/portfolio/scratchpad~~ a work in progress. I like to write about

- Things I've learned
- Silly side projects (usually, but not always hardware based)
- Random thoughts on software development

but anything goes! Maybe I'll post a recipe one of these days :man_shrugging:

### Saying hi!

If you want to say hi, you can reach me at [hello@nadav.ca](mailto:hello@nadav.ca). I'm always happy to hear thoughts about the things I've written (or the mistakes I've made). N'hésitez pas non plus à dire bonjour en français!
