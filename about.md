Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 

I'm a software developer... I think? I'm passionate about hardware, software, and many other subjects that I find enough time to geek out about!

This site is <del>my blog/portfolio/scratchpad</del> a work in progress. If you're reading this while you should be doing something useful, here are some <a href="https://archive.org/details/OceanSound-NatureSounds" title="Ok, maybe not so relaxing..." target="_blank">relaxing ocean sounds</a> to help you get back in the zone. Otherwise, enjoy! Oh  and please excuse my bad jokes, spelling, and technical mistakes.
