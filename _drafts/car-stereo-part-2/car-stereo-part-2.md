title: Car Stereo - Part 2 (The Cable)
---
This is the second part of a series on spoofing an iPod for car stereo shenanigans, [read part 1 here](https://nadav.ca/2021/01/29/car-stereo-part-1/).

Before being able to spoof an iPod, my first step was to figure out how the car talks to a real one. I tried the simplest thing I could think of first, plug my iPhone directly into the car using the lightning cable. No dice. Next, I dug up an old iPod nano, and plugged that in using a standard 30-pin dock connector cable. Still no luck. 

It's at this point that I realized that there must of been something special with Hyundai's cable. Not wanting to shell out $50 on one, I found a cheap knock-off on Aliexpress and tried that instead. After waiting about a month for the cable to arrive, I plugged it in and it still didn't work.

I figured if I was going to figure out how it worked, I would have to get a genuine cable. As luck would have it, I found one on Kijiji for cheap.
