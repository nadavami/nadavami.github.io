description: A list of links to common DNS cache purge forms

Like many today, I woke up to reading about [Facebook's major DNS outage](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28748203). While I'm looking forward to hopefully reading the outage's postmortem, in reading the comments I learned that you can actually "ask" many public DNS providers to flush the cache for one of their entires. This is super useful if you change a DNS entry and want the change to be seen by your users quicker. 

So for future me, here's a list of all the common DNS provider cache flush pages you could find.

- [Google](https://dns.google.com/cache)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare-dns.com/purge-cache/) 
- [OpenDNS](https://cachecheck.opendns.com/)
