  <time datetime="2021-03-11T23:04:00+00:00" class="post-date">March 11, 2021</time>
  <p>Yesterday, I was building a little home server out of some spare parts or I was until I hit a bit of a roadblock. When it came time to install the OS (<a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu Server</a> in this case), I realized I didn’t have a keyboard to configure the install.</p>

<p>A normal person would have just gone out and bought a keyboard and an experienced one would have <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/apbs02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preseeded the install</a> so it could run unattended.</p>

<p>Since I’m neither normal nor experienced, I built <a href="https://github.com/nadavami/idonthaveakeyboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idonthaveakeyboard</a>. An Arduino based USB keyboard that uses a serial console as the input. In other words, it lets me use my laptop’s keyboard as a USB keyboard for another machine.</p>

<p>Here’s a little run down of how to use it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get a compatible Arduino, program it and connect a USB&lt;&gt;Serial adapter to it’s TX/RX pins</li>
  <li>Plug the Arduino’s USB cable into the computer that’s missing a keyboard</li>
  <li>Plug the USB&lt;&gt;Serial adapter into the laptop that has a keyboard</li>
  <li>Open a terminal on the laptop and connect to the serial port (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>(Almost) anything you type into the terminal will show up on the other end as if it were being typed on a normal USB keyboard. Right now, it only sends arrow keys, return, backspace, and printable ASCII characters (because that’s all I needed).</p>

<p>And with that, I was able to successfully set up the OS! Job done!</p>

<p>Ok, maybe not… I had to change some BIOS settings and for whatever reason my fake keyboard wasn’t being recognized, so I went out and bought a real one ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
