  <p>I like my car, probably more then anyone should like a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. In 2021 terms it’s not the most technologically advance thing but it does most of what I need. While driving, I use my phone for navigation and music - both are extremely essential.</p>

<p>My car was built around the time of “peak iPod” and like many from that era, have enhanced support for the iPod. The Elantra does this via a proprietary cable with a 30-pin dock connector on one end and usb on the other. Thankfully, the car also supports bluetooth audio and handsfree calling. It even has steering wheel playback controls.</p>

<p>This is where my (entirely self-created) problems begin. You see, the playback controls are limited to volume up/down and track next/prev. Volume works great, no complaints there! However, the track next/prev only works when connected to an iPod.</p>

<p>Sure, I can (and occasionally do) yell at Siri to change the track, but it’s unreliable at best.</p>

<p>Like in most of my side projects, I set off to do what most reasonable wouldn’t. Trick the car into thinking it’s talking to an old school iPod and send back the track next/prev controls to my phone via bluetooth.</p>

<p>In the following few posts, I’ll be documenting my journey in attempting to build that thing<sup>[1]</sup>. <em>Edit: Part 2 is now up! You can <a href="/2021/02/11/car-stereo-part-2/">read it here</a>.</em></p>

<p><small>P.S. This project was started in the summer of 2019 and at the time of writing is still not really working, mostly because i’ve gotten used to yelling at Siri :)</small></p>
