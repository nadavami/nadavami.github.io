  <time datetime="2021-02-01T22:56:00+00:00" class="post-date">February 01, 2021</time>
  <p>This past weekend I was digging through an old hard drive when I came across a piece of software I wrote a while ago. In fact, itâ€™s the very first thing I ever opensourced. In the spirit of writing more and personal growth, I figured I would do a sort of code review and see if iâ€™ve improved at all from age 14 (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>So with out further ado, let me introduce you to dSearchr! You might be wondering what it does, so here is some quick info taken straight <del>out of 2009</del> from the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/dsearchr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code repo</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dSearchr is a simple single file, directory content search script written in PHP5.<br>
  It is highly customizable, and super easy to incorporate with your existing website.<br>
  Hiding files and and adding error messages is just as easy to do.<br>
  Best of all, thereâ€™s no SQL or databases, just point it to a directory and start searching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at that beautifully crafted pitch, and PHP5 - oh boy! Ok enough sarcasm, letâ€™s see the code.</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dca3e8d85fed71583dde8db17175f592.js?file=search.php"> </script>

<p><small><em>search.php, released Aug 28, 2009 in all of itâ€™s original glory</em></small></p>

<p>Ok, so itâ€™s pretty bad. Iâ€™ll start with the most general issues and then work my way down from the top.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Linting &amp; code format. Was linting a word in 2009? Iâ€™m not sure, but I clearly had never head it.</li>
  <li>Unrelated code. Lines 5 - 15 and pretty much all the HTML in the document should have been removed. Side note, at the time I was building a music player webapp so that I could learn the then newfangled HTML5 spec. The fact that you could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;audio&gt;</code> to embed audio was amazing, such simpler times!</li>
  <li>Variable names. What is $des? <sup><small>[get it, what is this?â€¦ sorryâ€¦]</small></sup> Variable names could have been much more clear and made the coder easier to read.</li>
  <li>Useless variable reassignment. Iâ€™m really not sure whatâ€™s up with lines 22 &amp; 23â€¦</li>
  <li>Weird conditional on line 27. Why not invert it at get rid of the else clause.</li>
</ol>

<p>A few years later, I was motivated me to release a few minor revisions, letâ€™s take a quick look at the last one.</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/17c10b0685918bf8a26dee05e3e86855.js?file=search.php"> </script>

<p><small><em>search.php v1.2! Now with less eye bleeding!</em></small></p>

<p>Itâ€™s still not great, but itâ€™s better! Soâ€¦ progress ðŸŽ‰! At itâ€™s peak, it had about 2000 downloads, a little wiki, and even a few bugs opened.</p>

<p>As a last little experiment, I thought it might be interesting to see what the code would look like if I refactored it today. Shout-out to <a href="https://sylhare.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@sylhare</a> for the suggestion.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/a80927a3a2ef872a8db37fd779752dad.js?file=search.php"> </script>

<p>Is it better? I mean, itâ€™s still PHP. <sup><small>Iâ€™m teasing of course, I write js for a living</small></sup></p>

<p>After basic linting, probably the most valuable change is moving the important (from a dev/user point of view) variables to the top of the file. Other then that itâ€™s just small enhancements. Putting the files to exclude in an array, excluding the name of the current file without hardcoding it, making a little utility function to make the code read a more naturally.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been quite some time since Iâ€™ve done any PHP, so iâ€™m sure there is still room for improvement.</p>

<p>Anyways, the code itself is not what actually matters with these kinds of projects and I hope this post proves that. I think what matters is making shit and putting it out there. It doesnâ€™t matter how small, how simple or how useless. Someone else might find value in it and to me that makes it worth it. Plus, I think itâ€™s also pretty cool to be able to look back on how youâ€™ve improved (or havenâ€™t) over time!</p>
