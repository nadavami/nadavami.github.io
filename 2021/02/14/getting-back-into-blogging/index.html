  <p>Writing is hard. Writing consistently is even harder. Here’s a list of things I’m doing to motivate myself to get back into writing and posting regularly. Time will tell if it works.</p>

<h3 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good">Perfect is the enemy of good</h3>
<p>A post doesn’t have to be perfect to be published. Finding out that my most viewed post is one I put very little effort into helped a lot.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-things-into-manageable-pieces">Breaking things into manageable pieces</h3>
<p>The projects I do usually span weeks or months. Sometimes I shelve them because of lack of interest, missing parts/knowledge, etc. Breaking posts into smaller pieces means I can keep the writing momentum going without waiting until the whole thing is done - or worse “ready”, whatever that means.</p>

<h3 id="making-this-place-my-own">Making this place my own</h3>
<p>Sometimes I need to remind myself that this is <em>my</em> site. I can write about whatever I want. It also means I can go back and edit a post if I feel like it. Make myself the primary audience takes a lot of the writing anxiety away.</p>

<h3 id="seeing-page-view-stats">Seeing page view stats</h3>
<p>Even though I’m writing for myself, it’s nice to see people reading what I wrote. I debated for a long time if I should use google analytics. It’s surprisingly motivating to see the views come in and I regret not doing it sooner. If google analytics bothers you, I encourage you to block it. I do.</p>

<h3 id="make-a-list-of-things-i-want-write-about">Make a list of things I want write about</h3>
<p>I keep a little list on my phone and jot down post ideas as they come to me. When I’m ready to start writing, I can take something from the list if I can’t think of anything to write about. I also keep a drafts folder <a href="https://github.com/nadavami/nadavami.github.io/tree/main/_drafts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed to git</a>. As I’m working on a project, I throw things in the draft file. It makes it much easier to start a post when the page isn’t blank.</p>
